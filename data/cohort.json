            "bio": "<p>Borne from the dusty fields of northeastern Colorado, I have lived a wild life. I ventured off one week after high school to start a five-year enlistment in the U.S. Marine Corps. In the Marines, I worked as an aviation electrician on CH-53E helicopters. This journey took me to some amazing places, including Kosovo, Bahrain, and eventually Iraq. After completing my enlistment, for which I received an honorable discharge, I returned to Colorado to get a BA in broadcast journalism. Soon after graduation, I learned journalism wasn't my chosen field, nor was being a chef after a year of culinary arts school. I dabbled as an entrepreneur, liquor store manager, and finally wound up in insurance. I love to learn, and obtained numerous insurance industry certifications as well as an MBA with a concentration in IT Project Management. Needing a change of scenery, I took a chance by moving to Nashville nearly three years ago, and landed at Asurion. Still in love with technology, I jumped at the chance to become a software developer through the company's apprenticeship program. I have learned a ton through NSS, and have had just enough time to nearly complete an MS in software design and programming. Everything has brought me to this point, and I firmly believe that software development IS my chosen field.</p><p>When not working or hitting the books, I love to spend time with my wife and our three dogs. I'm a big sci-fi and marvel geek, and eagerly look forward to the next great movie or bingeable TV series. I enjoy cooking, going to craft breweries, and spending time with friends. I also participate in axe throwing leagues and tournaments in Clarksville and Nashville. Axe throwing is an amazingly supportive community, and the highlight of the week for me. I also deeply enjoy making people laugh, dropping trivia nuggets on the unsuspecting, and suggesting beer/wine pairings for anyone's dinner plans. This is a very exciting time for me, and I'm eager to see where this road leads. </p>",

            "bio": "<p>Originally from St. Paul, Minnesota, I finally moved to Nashville in January 2019 after several years of visits and vacations. A bartender by trade, I've always had a knack for tech. From building PC's to writing code and everything in between. As I got older, I found myself more and more interested in software development. That led me to several different free online courses and youtube tutorials. In 2019, I decided that coding was something I thought I could make a career out of but I wanted more professional direction. That's when I found Nashville Software School. I attended an info session at the school in the winter of 2019 with plans to apply for the spring. Unfortunately, Covid-19 had other plans...Fast forward a year and a half however, and I was invited to join Cohort 52! It has been a wonderful experience so far and I look forward to what comes next!</p>",
